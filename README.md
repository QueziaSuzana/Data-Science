# Data Science Projects 

This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments I developed during my academic journey and practical experience in Data Science. Youâ€™ll find notebooks, data analyses, visualizations, machine learning models, and other solutions applied to real-world or academic problems.

The goal of this repository is to showcase my skills with tools such as Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQL, and more, as well as my ability to explore, clean, and interpret data to extract valuable insights.

This is a living repository, continuously updated with new experiments, challenges, and learnings from my professional and academic path.
