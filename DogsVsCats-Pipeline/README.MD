# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification with CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model was developed using TensorFlow/Keras and includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation components.

## Key Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom CNN architecture with regularization
- Model evaluation with precision/recall metrics
- Class imbalance handling techniques

## Results Summary
The model achieved the following performance:

| Metric        | Cats  | Dogs  | Overall |
|---------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Precision     | 88.6% | 61.7% |         |
| Recall        | 41.3% | 94.7% |         |
| F1-Score      | 56.4% | 74.7% |         |
| Accuracy      |       |       | 68.0%   |
